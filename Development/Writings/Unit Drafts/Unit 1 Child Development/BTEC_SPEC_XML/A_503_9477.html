                        <p>While children are all different and special, groups of children of the same age
                        usually share quite a few characteristics. Babies are known to cry and crawl, while
                        2 year olds have a reputation for tantrums. Most 3 year olds seem to love dressing-up,
                        while 5 year olds are keen to tell on anyone breaking the ‘rules’. Child development
                        helps to explain why children share certain characteristics but equally why two children
                        of the same age can be so different.</p>
                        
                        <p>In this unit, you will learn about the ways in which growth and development are
                        interlinked. This interlinking is why we often talk about children’s ages, as well
                        as their stages of development. You will learn about children’s development in five
                        broad areas: physical, cognitive, language, emotional and social, and will see how
                        these areas of development are interlinked.</p>
                        
                        <p>You will learn that there are many theories of why, and how, children develop and
                        a range of factors that seem to influence the development of individual children.
                        The knowledge you gain from this unit will help you with the rest of this qualification.
                        It will also be the key to your professional work with children: recognising a child’s
                        stage of development will allow you to plan for this and support them effectively.</p>

                     a wide range of practical activities so that children can develop schemas by being
                     active learners.</li>
                     <li>	How to use Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development model to observe what a child
                     can do and then work alongside the child to further the child’s development through
                     the use of interaction and sensitive questions.</li>
                     <li>	How to use Athey’s schema theory to observe children’s use of schemas while playing

                     further.</li>
                     <li>	How to use Bruner’s theory by ensuring that the curriculum is based on learning
                     through play and activities; that adults spend time engaging and interacting with
                     children in order that children can make connections between what they are doing and
                     their past experiences.</li>

                     aids, props and timetables to assist processing; giving children enough time to respond
                     when asking questions; the need to remind children to do things as they may not be
                     able to remember instructions; using practical activities and play as a way of teaching;
                     recognising that children of different ages will respond at different rates and so
                     ensuring that younger children have more time to process instructions or new experiences.</li>
                     <li>	How to use the theory behind the Chomsky’s language acquisition device to ensure
