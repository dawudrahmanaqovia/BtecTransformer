<i_t>Unit introduction</i_t>
<i_te>While children are all different and special, groups of children of the same age usually share quite a few characteristics. Babies are known to cry and crawl, while 2 year olds have a reputation for tantrums. Most 3 year olds seem to love dressing-up, while 5 year olds are keen to tell on anyone breaking the &#8216;rules&#8217;. Child development helps to explain why children share certain characteristics but equally why two children of the same age can be so different.</i_te>
<i_te>In this unit, you will learn about the ways in which growth and development are interlinked. This interlinking is why we often talk about children&#8217;s ages, as well as their stages of development. You will learn about children&#8217;s development in five broad areas: physical, cognitive, language, emotional and social, and will see how these areas of development are interlinked.</i_te>
<i_te>You will learn that there are many theories of why, and how, children develop and a range of factors that seem to influence the development of individual children. The knowledge you gain from this unit will help you with the rest of this qualification. It will also be the key to your professional work with children: recognising a child&#8217;s stage of development will allow you to plan for this and support them effectively.</i_te>

<la_te>The learner will be expected to show an understanding of aspects of theory; to analyse how theories and models of development relate to observations of children&#8217;s development; to identify the strengths and weaknesses of theories; to apply different theoretical approaches to unfamiliar scenarios; to compare theoretical approaches to specific areas of child development; to identify which theories or models of development link to what has been observed and explain why associations have been made; to be able to use the theories or models of development to make a judgement about what is being observed.
In applying these theories to unfamiliar scenarios, aspects of these theories and models of development will apply to a broader age range than birth up

<tg_te_s>Early Years Educator Qualifications Criteria</tg_te_s>
<tg_te>When delivering this unit, teachers/tutors must be aware of the terminology used within the Early Years Educator Qualifications Criteria published by the National College for Teaching &amp; Leadership, in particular for Section 1: Support and promote children&#8217;s early education and development (criteria 1.1&#8211;1.10) and 2: Plan to provide effective care, teaching and learning that enables children to progress and prepares them for school. Teachers/tutors must ensure that learners are familiar with the range of terminology used within the criteria.</tg_te>
<tg_te>In learning aim A, it is expected that an understanding of the principles of children&#8217;s growth and development will also include an understanding of the development of children&#8217;s learning.</tg_te>
<tg_te>Learners must understand that children&#8217;s development in one area may affect their development in other areas and that areas of development are interrelated. This may also be referred to as &#8216;holistic development&#8217;.</tg_te>
<tg_te>The development of children&#8217;s brains and neural growth may also be referred to as &#8216;neurological development&#8217;.</tg_te>
<tg_te>Under language development, the development of reading and writing can also be referred to as the development of literacy skills.</tg_te>
<tg_st>Assessment guidance</tg_st>
<tg_te>The words in bold, at the beginning of each learning aim in the unit content, indicate the ways that the unit content will be assessed. For example, under learning aim E, &#8216;the learner will be expected to analyse the ways in which atypical development in one or more areas of development may affect another area of development&#8217;, and questions will be set in the external assessment for the qualification to address this.</tg_te>
<tg_te>Knowledge of learning aim A &#8211; &#8216;how the principles of growth and development apply to children&#8217;s developmental progress&#8217; &#8211; informs and underpins the other learning aims in the unit.</tg_te>
<tg_te>This unit is externally assessed under examination conditions.</tg_te>
<tg_te>The external assessment will be in the format of a paper-based test, consisting of short and extended writing questions.</tg_te>
<tg_te>The paper has two sections with a total of 80 marks. The first section is based on a scenario. This requires learners to spend 15 minutes reading a scenario, before answering questions. Learners will need to apply their knowledge of child development to answer these questions. The second section will be made up of short- and extended- answer questions.</tg_te>
<tg_te>The external paper will test learners&#8217; understanding of, and ability to synthesise and apply, the knowledge base of the unit outlined in the Unit content section of the unit. Learners will be required to carry out analyses of issues presented in the scenarios. In addition, they will be expected to evaluate evidence, make judgements and draw conclusions from material presented in the scenarios, justifying their responses.</tg_te>
<tg_te>The quality of learners&#8217; written communication is not assessed in the external assessment. However, it is strongly recommended that learners, especially when engaged in extended writing during delivery of the unit, have opportunities to continue to develop their literacy skills.</tg_te>
<tg_st>Resources</tg_st>
<tg_te>There are no special resources needed for this unit.</tg_te>
