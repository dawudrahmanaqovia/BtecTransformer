   <title>Promoting Children’s Development Through Play</title>
   <description><![CDATA[
<p>We know that play has a pivotal role in helping children to learn new skills and knowledge. All early years settings now use play as a way of teaching children and supporting their development, and it forms the basis of early years frameworks.</p>

      <p>In this unit you will look at how early years settings use play to promote children’s learning and development at different ages and stages, including babies, and the types of play opportunities that early years settings usually provide. You will find that play can be structured in broadly three ways: adult-led, adult-initiated and child-initiated play. Each way has its benefits, but also potential disadvantages, and early years settings use a combination of these structures to support children’s play.</p>

      <p>By the end of this unit, you will have learnt that play is complex, yet very important to children’s learning and development.</p>

               <b>Topic A.1 How children play at different ages/stages of development</b>
            </p>
            <p>The nature of play is that it is enjoyable and motivating for children of all ages. It is used in early years settings to support children’s development. Learners must be able to understand that children at different ages/stages of development have different play needs as this is essential in providing play that ensures that children are sufficiently challenged, are engaged, find play enjoyable and learn new skills.</p>
            <p>
               <b>Play from birth up to two years:</b>
            </p>
            <p/>
            <ul>
               <li>significant time spent playing with adults, e.g. playing close to familiar adults, watching other children playing</li>
               <li>focus on moving and touching things, and until around eighteen months putting things in their mouths, e.g. exploring objects and their surrounding environment</li>
               <li>games and actions are repeated and remain enjoyable, e.g. knocking down towers 
of blocks, jack in the box, pushing toy cars down a slope.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               <b>Play</b>

            <p>at two up to five years:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>increasing interest in being with others and from three years starting to actively play with others, e.g. playing alongside other children, starting to take turns in play and beginning to learn to share</li>
               <li>play becomes more complex and requires greater gross and fine motor coordination, e.g. balancing on climbing equipment, throwing and kicking balls</li>
               <li>talk becomes central to play, especially during construction and imaginative play, e.g. talking through their actions and their experiences during play</li>
               <li>children may need adults to play with them and to provide supervision and support, e.g. wanting adult encouragement and reassurance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               <b>Play</b>
            </p>
            <p>at five up to eight years:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>begin to increasingly organise and structure their play with minimum adult support, e.g. making decisions about how they want to play and what resources they need</li>
               <li>they may introduce their own rules, e.g. making games more challenging, choosing who can join in</li>
               <li>play is complex and requires increasing levels of skill, e.g. involving physical challenge and a combination of skills.</li>

            <p>The importance of providing a range of different play opportunities to ensure that children learn a range of skills across each of the areas of development (physical, cognitive, language and communication development, emotional and social). The importance of early years settings providing different play opportunities according to the age/stage of the child. Learners must be able to describe play opportunities to promote development in each of the age ranges (birth up to two years, two up to five years and five up to eight years). Learners must know how the play opportunities promote skills in the areas of development and how each play opportunity could promote more than one area of children’s development.</p>
            <p>
               <b>Play opportunities from birth up to two years:</b>
            </p>
