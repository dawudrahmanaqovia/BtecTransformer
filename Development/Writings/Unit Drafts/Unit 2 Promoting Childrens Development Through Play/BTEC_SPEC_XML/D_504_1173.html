                        <h2>Unit introduction</h2>
                        <p>We know that play has a pivotal role in helping children to learn new skills and
                        knowledge. All early years settings now use play as a way of teaching children and
                        supporting their development, and it forms the basis of early years frameworks.</p>
                        
                        <p>In this unit you will look at how early years settings use play to promote children’s
                        learning and development at different ages and stages, including babies, and the types
                        of play opportunities that early years settings usually provide. You will find that
                        play can be structured in broadly three ways: adult-led, adult-initiated and child-initiated
                        play. Each way has its benefits, but also potential disadvantages, and early years
                        settings use a combination of these structures to support children’s play.</p>
                        
                        <p>By the end of this unit, you will have learnt that play is complex, yet very important
                        to children’s learning and development.</p>

                     <p>The nature of play is that it is enjoyable and motivating for children of all ages.
                     It is used in early years settings to support children’s development. Learners must
                     be able to understand that children at different ages/stages of development have different
                     play needs as this is essential in providing play that ensures that children are sufficiently
                     challenged, are engaged, find play enjoyable and learn new skills.</p>
