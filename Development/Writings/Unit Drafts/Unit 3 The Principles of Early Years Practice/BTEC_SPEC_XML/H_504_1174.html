                        <p>There are some general principles that underpin work in early years settings. These
                        principles shape the way settings are run and the ways in which adults in settings
                        work with children and their families.</p>
                        
                        <p>In this unit you will look at some of the key principles that are reflected in
                        best practice in early years. You will learn about inclusive practice as a way of
                        valuing children and ensuring that they can benefit from the opportunities within
                        the setting. You will also explore how children are empowered to ensure that children
                        learn to become independent and develop a strong self-image, as well as ways in which
                        this is put into practice.</p>
                        
                        <p>A further principle of working with children is the key person approach, which
                        early years settings use to meet children’s emotional and care needs. In this unit,
                        you 
                        will learn why the key person approach is important to children’s learning and development.
                        If you wish to work in early years, it is important that you have a 
                        good understanding of the principles as you will need to incorporate them into 
                        your practice.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Learners must understand reasons why early years settings seek to empower children
                     and how empowerment contributes to children’s learning and development. Definition
                     of empowerment: giving children involvement in decisions that affect them, appropriate
                     to their age and level of understanding. Why early years settings seek to empower
                     children:</p>
                     <ul>
                     <li>children have a right to be informed, involved and consulted about all decisions
                     that affect them</li>
                     <li>to value children as their feelings and opinions are taken into account</li>
                     <li>to show respect to children</li>
                     <li>to help children to respect themselves and others</li>
                     <li>to involve children in decision making, e.g. play opportunities, routines.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>How empowerment benefits children, including:</p>
                     <ul>
                     <li>benefits to physical development, e.g. children gain confidence to try new challenges,
                     more motivated to practise skills, helps children to make decisions about risk</li>
                     <li>benefits to emotional development e.g. self-esteem encouraged from being given
                     opportunities to be involved in decision-making processes, more likely to be able
                     to manage own behaviour if they have had some input in decisions about appropriate
                     behaviour, boundaries and expectations</li>
                     <li>benefits to social development, e.g. children develop self-respect and learn to
                     respect and value others and the feelings of others</li>
                     <li>benefits to cognitive development, e.g. involvement in decision-making process
                     encourages motivation, perseverance and concentration.</li>

                     of development. Ways adults in early years settings empower children appropriate to
                     their age/stage of development, including:</p>
                     <ul>
                     <li>involving children in physical care routines and encouraging them to be involved
                     in self-care to support independence, e.g. washing, dressing</li>
                     <li>giving children appropriate control and privacy when dressing, e.g. half closing
                     a door so that toddlers can use the toilet in private</li>
                     <li>encouraging children to help themselves at meal and snack times</li>

                     how they play, and with whom</li>
                     <li>involving children in planning so that children feed back what they have enjoyed
                     doing and can make suggestions as to what they wish to do next</li>
                     <li>involving children in all aspects of preparing the environment, e.g. choosing
                     equipment to put out, tidying away, preparing snacks.</li>
