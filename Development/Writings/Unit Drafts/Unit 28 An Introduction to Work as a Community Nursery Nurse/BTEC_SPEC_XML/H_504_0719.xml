   <title>An Introduction to Work as a Community Nursery Nurse</title>
   <description><![CDATA[
<p>Did you know that Community Nursery Nurses work closely under the supervision of health visitors to improve the health and wellbeing of families with children under 8? Health promotion involves preventing ill health and early detection of health difficulties. Promoting childrenâ€™s health includes immunisation and developmental screening programmes. It also involves advising and supporting parents to prevent accidents in the home and provide a healthy diet for their children.</p>

      <p>The knowledge and skills you have developed about work with young children complement the work of the health visiting service. Health visitors have a primary role in promoting child health and Community Nursery Nurses support the work of the health visiting team in this.</p>

      <p>In this unit you will learn about the roles and responsibilities of Community Nursery Nurses. You will learn about child health promotion and the skills required by Community Nursery Nurses to be effective in promoting child health by encouraging participation through the development of trusting, respectful relationships with families.</p>
